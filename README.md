The React Notebook App is a simple yet functional note-taking application built using React and Vite. It allows users to create, view, search, and delete notes — making it a great example of working with dynamic state, props, event handling, and component-driven architecture in React.

🔧 Features
Add Notes: Users can input a title and description to create new notes.

Delete Notes: Each note has a delete button to remove it individually.

Search Notes: Live filtering based on title or description via a search bar.

No Note Fallback: Shows a placeholder message when there are no notes.

Modular Components: Separation of concerns using reusable components like NoteBookCard, DisplayComponent, and SearchBar.

💻 Tech Stack
Frontend: React (with hooks like useState)

Build Tool: Vite (super fast bundling with Hot Module Replacement)

Styling: Tailwind CSS (or replaceable with any CSS framework)

Linting: ESLint setup for clean code practices

🛠️ How It Works
NoteBookCard: A form component where users input their note.

DisplayCard: Renders each note and provides a delete button.

SearchBar: Captures input to filter notes in real time.

App.jsx: Manages overall state and renders components conditionally.

🚀 Possible Improvements
Persist notes using localStorage or a backend database.

Add editing functionality.

Improve UX with animations and notifications.

Add TypeScript for stronger typing and developer tooling.
